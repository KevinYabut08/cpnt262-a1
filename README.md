### "Code Journal"
In this assignment, I was able to learn some new stuff about javascript. I also encountered some problems which I didn't know how to solve. This website contains a carousel of pictures which is generated through javascript. At first, I wasn't able to make my previous and next button work and then I asked Temi about it and she hlped me understand about the logic and the ifs of it that's why I was able to make my carousel work. The image gallery in this gave me a hard time in making it work because I was used to making image gallery through css but hten I asked Ashlyn about it and she told me to use some forEach stuff in javascript and then it worked out pretty well. I also had some helped from chat gpt, w3schools, and codepen in making my toggles and buttons. I used them in order for me to understand the codes and other stuff. This assignment was a tough one but thankfully I made a full page website oout of it. I was also hopig to put some videos in my carousel and my gallery images clickable but I need to study more about javascript in order to do it. It was har coding this assignment but it really feels nice when your code is working at the end of the day. I hope theat I'll learn more about javascript even though I don't understand some part of the lessons from it.
